## Introduction

Christopher Nolan is regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the decade. He is known for his realistic take on Batman and Gotham has won awards for his mind-bending take on science-fiction. With films like Interstellar and Inception to his name and a penchant for compelling people to ``re-watch and rethink", he has already piqued the interest of the audience since his first outing in feature-length films in 1998.

## Nolan the "independent"

When you talk of Nolan, the first thing to come to mind is the way he chooses to tread all the way with new ideas. One of the reasons we never see a popcorn flick from him is because he isn't here to hoodwink you. He's here to compel you to think about the situation in front of you, and thus seeps in the message, that is the "specific purpose" of his film.

All that dare in him, all that effort to put the message across, all the effort he makes to compel you to think, comes from his roots in the independent film industry. His first independent feature film, "Following", was so well-received that it was regarded the "Best First Feature Film" of 1998. Since then, he made independent films till his foray into mainstream film in the year 2003 with "Insomnia". But here's the thing: Because of his background in independent film, his set of beliefs are a bit different from everybody else. He is a firm believer of the power of film-stock over digital camera, and practical effects over CGI (computer-generated imagery). Each of his films indirectly leaves you with a question - Is it justified? And does it matter whether it's justified or not? There is always an aesthetic to his films, the kind you can only find in an independent, story-driven feature film. Thus, one can also call Nolan the "Independent" in the mainstream.

## Batman in film

Batman was really popular in film upto the 80s and early 90s, but that took a declining path in 1995 with “Batman Forever”, and further in 1997 with "Batman and Robin", which were super-star ensembles that failed.   Before that, we had Michael Keaton play the role of Batman, and there was this one time where Danny DeVito played the role of "The Penguin", one of Batman’swell-known enemies, in ``Batman Returns" and that performance in particular was well-received. Of course, as we would later find out, from 2014 to early 2019, we got an even better (Danny DeVito certified it as such), hotter, and the first LGBT version of "The Penguin", played by openly gay, and married, Robin Lord Taylor in his breakout role on TV in the FOX TV show "Gotham". Poor guy had no great job before that,  and literally cried when he received the good news about the role while binge-eating - you can hear his story on Queen Latifah’s talk show. But as far as film was concerned, Batman fans had almost lost all hope of ever getting a good film or a good set of films about Batman in the late 90s.

Warner Bros. were looking for ways to cauterize the deep figurative wound on Batman's future in live-action film with numerous pitches coming in for a continuation of Batman, and finally they decided that they needed a fresh approach, one that's independent of the big-budget mindset. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan was looking for something to do, and Dan, his agent, rang up his wife Emma Thomas, and told her Warner Bros. was looking to make a Batman film, and Emma, a bit dismissively, told him she will think about it. When Nolan heard from her about the offer, he thought it was really exciting because he always thought there was always a Batman story that hadn't been brought on screen yet. This lit Emma up and they decided to work on the project.

## Nolan's Batman

Nolan wanted to capture the true essence of Batman in the film he was going to make. He had always worked with the plan that this is a one-off film he was going to make, and he and his team would have to give their everything into making it happen in the best way possible. Nolan's idea was to explore the mind and the experiences of Bruce Wayne from the time his parents were murdered to his first major outing as Batman, essentially giving the superhero an origin story if you look at it in one way, and doing a character study of the two different personas in the process. Yes, the basic fabric comes from Frank Miller's comics, but the exploration into the psychological evolution of Bruce Wayne, from a parent-less childhood to a friendless adult existence, that's Nolan's spin on the character. Nolan wanted to focus on this evolution of Bruce Wayne from a restless, directionless teenager with a bone to pick, to an adult self-imbued with a purpose, when he was pitching Batman Begins to the studio.

## The Plot

The plot skeleton is simple. Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered. This drives him in his adult existence to take a stand against criminals by travelling the world to understand the criminal mind and train himself to fight injustice, and then come back to Gotham to start a long, centered crusade against crime as the Batman.

As the great Roger Ebert said while critiquing this film, "The story of why he identifies with bats (childhood trauma) and hates evildoers (he saw his parents killed by a mugger named Joe Chill) has been referred to many times in the various incarnations of the Batman legend, including four previous films. This time, it is given weight and depth." I agree. There's long-lasting implications of trauma like this, and Nolan has beautifully explored how and why Bruce, in his own mind, is static on his parents' murder, and how this static position, and the childhood incident with bats, together shape the rest of his journey into becoming Batman.

The movie opens with two children, a young Bruce Wayne and a young Rachel Dawes, playing in the Wayne Manor gardens, a scene that resembles of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Bruce then falls down the well he hid behind for hide and seek, and then finds himself surrounded by bats. Then we cut to adult Bruce Wayne in a Bhutanese jail, where we see him fight some of the inmates who create trouble for him. This adult Bruce is a far cry from the playful kid Bruce with a twinkle in his eyes whom we saw in the opening - this is somebody who looks like he's fallen on hard times and has somehow survived. The contrast, the vast difference between these two points in Bruce's timeline, is remarkable.

The next plot point is Bruce being bailed out of jail and journeying into the mountains to find a flower and bring it to the man who freed him. This man is Henri Ducard, who speaks for Ra's al-Ghul and offers Bruce a way to become better as a warrior of justice. Ra's al-Ghul and Henri Ducard then train Bruce after he brings the blue flower to their temple. After his training is complete, they try to get him to join the League of Shadows, an organisation that is notorious in the comics, but Bruce, after hearing the plan they have for Gotham, which is to destroy it and rebuild it, because "it's beyond saving", violently refuses to stand for it. Ra's al-Ghul even compares Gotham to Constantinople and Rome, calling it "a breeding ground for suffering and injustice".

Another plot point that runs concurrently with the training is a teenaged Bruce returning from Princeton Univ for the publicised hearing of Joe Chill's bail and conceals a firearm in his sleeve, having planned to assassinate him. While he talks to Rachel, it's clear that while people thought this gave him closure, in reality, it only made him angrier in the bones. When he shows Rachel the firearm, telling her "I'm not one of your good people", she tells him, "Your father would be ashamed of you" after giving him a slap and then we cut to him standing near the river, looking at the firearm, which reminds him of the murder of his parents again, compelling him to throw it away into the river. After that he storms into Falcone's, is seated, insulted, and then thrown out of the bar, before he decides to run away miles from Gotham. Concurrently, in the present, he's also narrating his experience with criminals to Ducard, while we get a glimpse of these experiences, leading up to his arrest in Bhutan and to the present.

The next plot point is Bruce's return to Gotham. Bruce had been away for 7 years and in that time, his share of the company was safe with Alfred while he was "declared dead". Bruce enters the company building to the shock of the new CEO. Mr. Earle, who realises his job in the company might be at stake, approaches Bruce as if greeting an old friend, and allows him to work for Applied Sciences, headed by Dr. Lucius Fox, which in reality is a "concealed dead-end" of sorts to keep Fox out of the board after the death of Thomas Wayne. Dr. Lucius Fox was a member of the Board before Earle reassigned him to archives. We also get to see Rachel Dawes taking a stand as the firebrand assistant DA of Gotham, and it's clear that she harbours a skepticism of sorts that some things are just too clean or too good or too swift to be even true.

Meanwhile, there's James Gordon, who we first saw as a beat cop without glasses, consoling the young Bruce who had just been waiting on the chair immediately after the murder. When the movie opens, we see him as a Detective Sergeant with glasses, and one can take a look at him and tell that he's struggling, being one of the few honest cops in the city. Bruce Wayne remembers Gordon from childhood as the beat-cop who put the coat on him and consoled him. When Bruce returns to Gotham to start a crusade against crime, we see the image of Gordon (in specs and a long overcoat) in a newspaper clipping Bruce is looking at when he's at home. We see Gordon and his assigned partner Arnold Flass in a car, talking, and we come to know, in this scene, how different he is from the other cops, when he says "I'm no rat.... In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?", showing his disgust at the lack of integrity in the police department and the government, thus suggesting he's the firebrand.

Next, we see Bruce creating the identity of Batman, with a Nomex survival suit that he paints black, which he uses first to approach Gordon while wearing a ski mask, and then adds the cape and cowl to it to finally make his first in-costume appearance as Batman. We see the Batarangs being tested, the cowl going through a strength test with a baseball bat (and there's 10,000 more in tow because filthy rich), and the addition of a communication device to the mask. We also see the cape in the testing room, made of memory cloth that can take specific shapes. It's a genius move that Nolan made that allows him to use harnesses for Batman's flight and conceal it well, because it isn't really flight but gliding, ultimately. The fight at the docks where he knocks out all of Falcone's men working there, it introduces us to Batman and the Batarang gives us the symbol of the Batman, a symbol that will, in later stages, serve as a beacon of hope. What's more, at the end of the fight, when Batman's gone away from the scene, we see Gordon entering the scene and to his and everybody else's surprise (and delight, possibly, deep down), Falcone is chained to a searchlight in a way that when lit up, the searchlight acts as a Bat-signal of sorts, or a calling card if you think of Batman as a fighter with a penchant for theatrics.

From then on, we see him helping Rachel get a hold of evidence on Falcone's concealed drug imports, and Dr. Crane at his absolute lying calmest. We also see Crane's scarecrow mask for the first time, and we see how he maintains the lie that the criminals he harbours at Arkham Asylum are really insane. Later, when Rachel Dawes visits Dr. Crane, she sees him for who he really is, and her suspicions are proven true when Crane takes her downstairs to the basement, revealing what he has been doing down there - mixing the shipped drugs into the water supply - before spraying the fear gas and capturing her. Even though the police arrive, they are not able to stop the drugs from going into the water, but Batman reaches there and takes Rachel away to his Batcave, before removing his cowl and getting ready for his birthday party as Bruce Wayne. This is where the big reveal happens - Ducard is actually Ra's al-Ghul and he's been planning on destroying Gotham using economics and drugs against it. This brings me to the monorail scene, where the monorail, from where Thomas Wayne once showed Bruce his office buildings and also narrated the history of the monorail, becomes a crucial part of Ra's al-Ghul's plan to destroy Gotham by spreading the fear gas (Remember when he said - "And The Word Is...PANIC!") and having people tear each other to shreds in fear and desperation, but before he can do that, Bruce destroys one link of the monorail, and glides away from it, with his parting words being "I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you", leaving Ra's al-Ghul to die.

## So what worked?

The film, by itself, is considered an independent and influential masterpiece. One of the reasons is its deviation from the usual narrative of a superhero story and an anti-climactic finalisation of the Batman persona. Another thing that works is the special Nolan signature - minimal CGI, more practical effects, a logical flow and the conception of cinematic realism modeled on our own world.\

If I were to say how much Nolan understood Batman, I think it would be fitting to say he understood the character more than anybody else who made a live-action Batman film, and really captured the essence of Batman. What makes this more coherent is the way the identity is pieced together, invented along the way in a trial-and-error manner, with each part being tested. The Batmobile, unlike previous swanky iterations, looks like a tank and a Lamborghini had a baby that grew up to be mean, and rightly so, since it is a mean machine, unchained, untethered, ready to strike. The cast, each and every one of them has given their best performances yet, and the fact that this is an origin story, one that was never addressed in the comics or previous films, adds some novelty to the film. Apart from that, it feels as though every important plot point in the film is a thought experiment, one where we are indirectly allowed to participate.

At the time of its release, it was one of the few superhero films that didn't outright scream superhero, but rather let it seep in. Yes, the title has "Batman" written over it but it doesn't scream "superhero" at you immediately. That's what makes this film even better, because it also set the film apart from the known superhero movies that came before it, which tried to throw at you in the first few seconds itself that they are superhero films. I'm looking at you, X-Men franchise, Spiderman trilogy and the Batman Anthology.

Another reason why this movie works is that each sub-plot has been given enough breathing space to develop and enough focus to unfold. Be it Batman being pieced together, or Gordon and his moral conflict with Loeb, or the big reveal, each sub-plot has been laid out well. On top of that, there's a realism in the plot that Nolan makes apparent. Add to that the attention to detail given by him and you can call it a Nolan film.

What externally made the film work was the absence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which set the bar for the shortest gap between subsequent movies of a franchise. When Batman Begins came out, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was still an idea, and there was no time pressure to release sequels between movies, which is why there's about 3 years of gap between this film and its sequel "The Dark Knight", and 4 years between that and "The Dark Knight Rises". Clearly, Nolan's approach to the story of and the idea behind Batman, made his case for being allowed to get a trilogy-style closure.

## Soundtrack

When talking about Batman Begins, we cannot forget the thumping soundtrack that is considered one of the best. A well-made combination of orchestra and electronica, it is divided into 12 tracks, each track actually named after a bat species, and rightly so, since a rhythmic flapping of wings of a bat serves as the opening motif of some of the tracks of the album. There's an easter egg in the track names as well, but I leave it to the reader to find out. The main theme of Batman for this film, and for the rest of the trilogy, is captured in the track 'Molossus', where the orchestra focuses on each note before going to the next, at times stretching out the note by adding fullness to it. Overarched by the 2-note motif which starts to dissociate all the notes of the track into two, providing an alternation between one chord and the other, the soundtrack captures Bruce's struggle and journey into the dark, his turning into Batman, and truly becoming a symbol of hope for the people and fear for the criminal. Fair warning to those who listen to it: Sit and listen, because the thumping rhythm of the theme can cause you to sometimes think of becoming a hero yourself.

## My take on the film

I watched previous Batman films and also the TV series Gotham, before I ended up watching Batman Begins. I must say, I found Nolan's idea of Batman to be the most sensible and the most realistic of all versions, and it was a visual treat to watch Bruce piece the suit together to become Batman. It was a treat to watch Gary Oldman rock the daddy mustache and the specs as James Gordon, and for once, get Gordon's demeanour right. I felt the movie did justice to Bruce's story of becoming Batman.\

Each of the cast was well-placed and did a great job with their performances. Special mentions go to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for their splendid performances as Dr. Lucius Fox and Alfred Pennyworth. As for the villains, special mentions go to Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy for their hair-raising portrayals of Ra's al-Ghul and Dr. Crane.

As for the cinematography, I felt that key scenes in the film, including the murder of Bruce's parents, the trial of Joe Chill, every fight scene, and every appearance of the Batmobile, were shot beautifully, and where alternation was needed, it was added in the right amount. I especially loved it when the alert beeping had complete rhythmic sync for a moment with the background track during the monorail scene. It shows that Nolan has musical awareness and leverages it well. I also loved the ending where Rachel and Bruce embrace and Rachel says Bruce's unmasked face is the real mask, because it suggested that Rachel understood the dangers Bruce had to face while being Batman and could not bear to lose him to it. Her parting words were "The man I loved..... Maybe someday when Gotham no longer needs Batman, I'll see him again."

A look at the whole world that has been built on the screen suggests that this is a world created with an eye to our own, a world reeling with post-9/11 trauma, and there are multiple subtle symbolisms in the movie to that end. This is also suggestive of Nolan's penchant for and insistence on realism. Another reason that this movie works is because of the screenwriting input by David S. Goyer, who wrote the screenplay for all of the Blade Trilogy, the film series which really cemented the basis for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

With so many things that Nolan got right about Batman and Gotham, I was looking forward to know what happened to Arkham Asylum after the climax, because if you are going to create a movie thinking of the message and assume that there might not be a sequel, you must also think of resolving any questions the audience might possibly have. When you talk of Batman's world, a key location which makes the stories about Gotham City so interesting is the Arkham Asylum, which the director did not focus upon. I guess that's what you get for having to create a realistic world where a place like Arkham Asylum would rather be in the dumps and forgotten than be a key location. This is my only complaint with the film.

Overall, giving a calming, temporary happy ending (laden with callbacks) of sorts and also giving us a hint of the Joker's arrival to close the plot of the movie, giving a thumping, heroic, operatic soundtrack to the story, adding realism to the cinematography, it all worked for this film. This is truly the film to add value to the story of Batman, while also giving us, the audience, lessons and quotes to drive home with, and if it were to have a sequel, it has given us a subtle hint for one. ``Batman Begins" finally got it right, and it's time that filmmakers relearn a thing or two about franchises and handling the superhero genre from here.

My ratings for this film:

- **Story**: 4 / 5
- **Cinematography**: 4.5 / 5
- **Soundtrack**: 5 / 5
- **Cast**: 4.5 / 5
- **USP**: Realism, a Christian Bale throwback performance, and a Gary Oldman family-man good-guy special performance.

Overall Score: 4.5 / 5
