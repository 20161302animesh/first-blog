## Introduction

Christopher Nolan is regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the decade. One of his greatest movies is the incredibly crafted follow-up to Batman Begins, "The Dark Knight", which had one of the most memorable villains, "The Joker", played by the late Heath Ledger, who departed this world after giving his best performance.

## Batman Begins - a recap

We saw Bruce Wayne create a full identity of Batman, and use that identity to confront criminals in the town. We also saw him take down his mentor-turned-villain, Ra's al-Ghul, and drive Crane to the shadows. We also saw him take over the company his dad had left for him in the hands of Mr. Earle and Alfred, and we finally got a hint that the Joker has arrived, and that Gordon and Batman are on the case.

## The Plot

The plot skeleton is simple. A new criminal, the Joker, has been running round robbing and blasting, unafraid of the Batman, and being an absurdist. Batman has to stop this criminal, but he also has to face the rage of the common people who think he's more a danger than a protector. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is thinking of retiring from being Batman because he wants to be with Rachel and Harvey Dent, the new district attorney, has been a pain in the ass for both the white-collar and the small-time criminals. Soon enough, Gordon and Dent plan to take down the Joker with the help of Batman, but everything falls apart and Dent loses Rachel to a bomb blast. With both his lover and his family gone, he's fed up of the system and becomes Two-Face. After the Joker's big plan (to show Batman how immoral Gotham really is) gets foiled by the people on the ferry, Joker is arrested, but Two-Face is mad, and is about to kill Gordon's son, when Batman saves the kid, and Harvey falls to his death. Batman and Gordon decide not to tell the people of Gotham about Harvey's crimes, and instead Batman takes the blame for Harvey's murder.

## So what worked?

The film, by itself, is considered an independent, transcendent masterpiece that goes beyond being just a superhero movie and gives us direct allegories to post-9/11 paranoia, as well as an ethical thought experiment towards the end. Another reason it had a pull was that people were excited about the Joker being around for future films but Heath Ledger, the actor playing the Joker, died before the release of the film. It seems like he went all in on this one, and it was his final complete performance, which people wanted to see, as a remembrance of and homage to him. For the uninitiated, Heath Ledger was a talented actor whose best known performance before "The Dark Knight" was as Ennis Del Mar in "Brokeback Mountain", a film that is lauded as a landmark in LGBT cinema and credited with influencing a lot of films and TV series featuring LGBT themes or characters.

At the time of its release, it was one of the few superhero films that didn't outright scream superhero, but rather let it seep in. Where "Batman Begins" had a focus on Ra's al-Ghul, fear, and economics, "The Dark Knight" focuses on chaos, control, and chance in a Gotham that knows about Batman and despises him. While "Batman Begins" focused on the origins of the caped crusader, "The Dark Knight" focuses on his beef with the Joker and introduces a big plot point whose effect doesn't stop when the credits roll on this one, but continues on in the next film.

Everything that "Batman Begins" got right, "The Dark Knight" does get right. What makes "The Dark Knight" a one-up from its immediate predecessor is that it invites us to make our own decision at key points in the film. Be it the ferry scene, where both the boats are rigged to blow as a social experiment, or the moment that the Joker gives Batman the addresses where Rachel and Harvey are tied up, giving him the choice to save only one, the audience inadvertently makes their own choice.

There is an allegory to Bush-era secret surveillance in the machine that Batman and Lucius use to locate the Joker. The machine uses SONAR data from the whole city to create a map to locate the Joker, and although "the database is null-key encrypted", the idea is intrusive and therefore feels ethically wrong for Lucius, who doesn't approve of being entrusted with personal data taken from the people of the city without their permission. Numerous books have been written on the scary idea of "surveillance capitalism", most notable being the one by Shoshana Zuboff in 2019, and although the movie doesn't completely explore how Lucius is affected by it in further volumes, it felt refreshing to see that it was acknowledged in a way, since Nolan is known to create cinematic worlds with an eye to our own.

What externally made the film work was the hype around Ledger's death, the allegory to "surveillance capitalism" that Nolan added to the movie, and most notably, the performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker, which caused the greatest pull for the film. Another thing that made the film work was the deviation from the usual narrative. Where usual superhero stories said "The hero always wins", this film said "The hero may try to hide it, but the villain was right. People will only hear what they already believe." Clearly, this movie strengthened the case for Nolan's Batman to get a trilogy-style closure.

## Soundtrack

When talking about "The Dark Knight", the orchestra maintains the 2-note motif from the previous films, but adds a slight violin falsetto and an electric guitar riff to the already thumping soundtrack, before reverting to the orchestral bit. There are new tunes as well, although the revolving note, the accompanying chord remains the same. A well-made combination of orchestra and electronica, it brings back 'Molossus', and adds the guitar riff and the violin falsetto to it. The soundtrack captures Bruce's further mental, physical and ethical struggles, and does it right. Fair warning to those who listen to it: get some strong speakers because we've got some hard riffs here.

## My take on the film

As always, I must give props to Christian Bale for his performance as Bruce Wayne. Each of the cast was well-placed and did a great job with their performances. Special mentions go to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for their splendid performances as Dr. Lucius Fox and Alfred Pennyworth. As for the villains, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was a class apart, and it was a new take on the Joker, one that massively trumps Jack Nicholson's performance in the 1989 Batman film, because it gets the ambiguity of origin right, and makes a strong case for being the true essence of the Joker as an absurdist and, as the Joker described himself, an "agent of chaos". I personally got goosebumps and a lot of take-home dialogues, a signature from all of Nolan's films. Aaron Eckhart, as Harvey Dent, gave a splendid, gritty performance channeling the "white knight" in the first half and the "dark side" in the second half of the film. His story arc was also well-written to match up to his villain name "Two-Face", and unlike the Two-Face from "Batman Forever" (1995) who looked like a cartoonish botch on a Chinese painting, this version of Two-Face had a reason for turning to chaos and chance. Gordon, as always, was a spot-on performance by Gary Oldman, and I loved it when he changed into a bottle-neck T-shirt and battle armor for a change, and sprung up in front of Joker. This incident, when he narrates to his son, he says, "This time, I saved him." A beautiful moment in an otherwise action-packed movie.

As for the cinematography, I felt that this tried to be as linear as possible, and it worked well. Key scenes in the film, including the street fight between Joker and Batman, the turn of Harvey Dent into Two-Face, were shot beautifully. I loved how they depicted the SONAR machine and finally, when its job was done, it's interface showed up, Lucius typed his name, and it was destroyed. The Machine itself was depicted well, and the destruction of it was even better.

A heart-wrenching moment was when Rachel's death was followed by Alfred receiving the letter, and in the end, we got to know that Rachel chose Harvey over Bruce, because Bruce had been consumed by the thoughts of being Batman and saving the people.

Overall, giving a deviating, shocking twist in the end, making the Joker a nameless absurdist instead of a mob enforcer with a past, giving a thumping, heroic, operatic soundtrack to the story, adding realism to the cinematography, it all worked for this film. This is a film that, I repeat, TRANSCENDS the superhero genre to give us a hard look at our own world, and give us a glimpse of the plethora of ethical anomalies that exist. The audience got a lot of lessons and quotes to drive home with. As I said before, it has made a strong case for a trilogy-style closure, by giving us a subtle hint that there's more to this story, and that the story is about to end soon.

My ratings for this film:
- **Story**: 5 / 5
- **Cinematography**: 5 / 5
- **Soundtrack**: 5 / 5
- **Cast**: 5 / 5
- **USP**: Multiple allegories to the real world, and a Heath Ledger departure special.

Overall Score: 5 / 5
