Hey everyone!

Hi!

This is my first ever blog. I tried to start one long ago, but it didn't work out.
Thankfully, it is working out now because of the pandemic.

Anyways...

Here's what you would mainly get in the blog:

- Movie Reviews

- Critical Analysis of Stuff

- My opinion about ongoing things.

- We will see what else we can add.

Soon, I will also add a post about who I am.

Thanks for reading, and keep following this blog as well.

Ciao!
